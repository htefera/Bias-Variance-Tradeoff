# Evaluation of Machine Learning algorithms and Bias Variance Trade off analysis

## I: Description of the experment
The objective of this assignment to evaluate machine learning algorithms on a given data
set and analyzing the bias variance tradeoff as complexity of the model increases to fit the
data using different polynomial regressions

The selected dataset consists of different attributes of the plant called abalone. The main
task of the experiment is predicting the age of the plant from different physical
measurements like height, width, height and others. The data sets consist of 4177
instances and 8 features and one target variable called rings which is the age of the plant.
The data is mainly collected for regression purpose.
